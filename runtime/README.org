* Runtime 

** Usage

This provides a library for running bots in a match against one
another. Each bot in the game has a process spawned for it. When it is
not a bot's turn the bot process is paused by sending SIGSTOP to the
process. When it is that bot's turn the process is resumed using
SIGCONT. 

When the bot process is spawned a stream is created for managing input
to the bot. When the bot reads from STDIN it gets data that has been
provided to the input stream.

A stream is also created for managing bot output. When the bot writes
to STDOUT the data is transferred the this stream's buffer and can be
read by the game runtime.
